#challenge-week-02

## The following web application is a personal portfolio built to display an image of me, a brief about me, links to different sections of the page and previews of work I have completed as a programmer. Additionally, there are also multiple listed ways to contact me and viewmy GitHub.## While building this project, I had in mind that wanted to make a web application accurately depicting a myriad of information regarding myself and my completed work as a programmer. I built this with the intention to, once I have projects completed, be able to display what I am capable of and what I have learned as I continue to improve and expand my knowledge. I decided to give myself a bit of a challenge on this project and researched a lot of ways to implement fun effects and ways to make my page more visually appealing. Additionally, I wanted to be sure this page was pleasant to view regardless of the device and made sure it adjusts as the browser or device changes. No doubt this all was difficult at times, but so much fun to piece together. 

## The application is simple to use. There is a navigation menu at the top right where clicking any of those links will bring you to the corresponding section of the portfolio. At the bottom of the page, I’ve listed a few ways to contact me, including a link that will bring the user to my GitHub page holding my repositories and previous coding work. Currently, there are no completed project in the “My work” section, but they’re coming soon! On top of that, I have not built a resume as I am still learning and haven’t had experience in this field aside from the program, so a tooltip was added to that navigation option to signify that, in time, there will be a link to my resume in the future.


## To access this web application, you can click the link provided(https://conquerershaki.github.io/portfolio/) or gain access to it through GitHub.

## I followed a couple of tutorials and referenced different code from developers who kindly shared their fun effects or other ideas to share with the world. I’ve linked them below to credit them.

Anything else referenced was from previous module 2 in-class activities I worked on with my cohorts.

## This project includes a few fun features. When using the mouse to hover over the “My work” images, there is a subtle glow effect around the border of the image. The text color gradient was a fun way to make the heading texts pop and I felt that using buttons instead of simple links for the navigation bar was a fun addition while also making the content fit in with the ultimate aesthetic and visual flow of the page.
